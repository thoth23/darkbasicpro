# Dark Basic Professional & DarkGDK Source Code #

### Introduction ###

Starting 2010, the core source code for Dark Basic Professional and DarkGDK was made available to all users of the software to pave the way for a new era in the development of this remarkable game creation system. Now you can drill down to the heart of every BASIC and C++ command, and discover precisely what your program is doing. Further, for those who are willing, an opportunity exists to make fixes and features to the engine instantly, allowing you to proceed with your DBP and GDK project without the intervention of the official team. Better still, you can contribute your fixes and features towards the official version, which will benefit the entire DBP and GDK communities.

The source code is available right here right now for those familiar with SVN repositories. For those who are unfamiliar with how SVN works, we will be making a tutorial video and step by step instructions on configuring a development environment and how to download and compile the code.
